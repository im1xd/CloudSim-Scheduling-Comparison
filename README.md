# CloudSim Scheduling Comparison

This project simulates and compares two different VM (Virtual Machine) scheduling policies — **Time-Shared** and **Space-Shared** — using the [CloudSim](https://www.cloudbus.org/cloudsim/) simulation toolkit.

## 🧠 Objective

The goal is to analyze and compare how Time-Shared and Space-Shared VM allocation affect the execution time of cloudlets in a simulated cloud environment.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Java
- CloudSim 3.0.3
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (for development)
- Git & GitHub

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Output

The simulation prints and compares the finish time of each cloudlet under both policies and calculates the average execution time for each:

| Policy        | Average Finish Time |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Time-Shared   | 44.06               |
| Space-Shared  | 66.90               |

This clearly shows the performance impact of scheduling strategies.
